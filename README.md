Currently I am a Lead AI Scientist at [Pi School](https://twitter.com/picampusschool). I have been working in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the last 4 years after a Ph.D. in Theoretical Particle\Statistical Physics ([SISSA](https://www.sissa.it/)). Particularly, I am applying Deep Learning and mostly Natural Language Processing (NLP) to solve problems that have a positive social or environmental impact (AI4Good). More in general I have a strong interest in AI research and Quantum Machine Learning, which is the common ground of my past and present. 

I am a Machine Learning lecturer at the [Master in HPC](https://twitter.com/mhpc_sissa_ictp) and at Bicocca University. By the way, I am a TED❌ speaker, a civil pilot, and I enjoy adventures (here my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/denocris/)).
